Exploratory personal projects for quant work on sports betting.

`chess_odds_modelling` covers a set of scripts used to try and model chess boards, to beat provider odds for live games.

`sports_cross_market_pricing` investigates discrepencies in pricing between different betting providers, for arbitrary sports games, and performs subsequent modelling of profitable strategies, with a Python-based app developed to automate the whole process.
