Node features:

- Black/white
- Piece type
- x coordinate
- y coordinate
- Points value

Edge features:

- Whether the piece is being "looked at" by or is "looking at" the other piece*

* As the edge is mutual, the edge feature must take any one of 4 values: 0, 1, 2, 3
0 means neither piece is "looking at" the other
1 means that piece A is looking at piece B, but not vice versa
2 means that piece B is looking at piece A, but not vice versa
3 means that both pieces are looking at eachother

piece A is by default the white piece, while piece B is the black piece (for a white/black interaction)
piece A is by default the higher value piece (with bishops considered as higher), while piece B is the lower value piece (for a same-colour interaction). For pawn-pawn interactions of the same colour, piece A is the pawn closest to the a-file, while piece B is the pawn closest to the h-file.

If a piece is taken, then it ceases to exist in the graph object.
